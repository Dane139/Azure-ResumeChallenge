My azure resume, following the [ACG project video.]()
 
 ## First steps

- Started by having to generate a new ssh key. Having never used github or git before I had to refer to resource on how to do it. Pretty simple.

- These 2 links helped me get that set up:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

- Front folder contains the website.
- main.js contains visitor counter code.
