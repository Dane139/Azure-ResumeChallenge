# Azure-Resume
My azure resume, following the [ACG project video.]()
 
 ## First steps

- Started by having to generate a new ssh key. Having never used github or git before I had to refer to resource on how to do it. Pretty simple.

- These 2 links helped me get that set up:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

- Front folder contains the website.
- main.js contains visitor counter code.

-trying to get azure function core tools installed took ages
https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/releases
found the msi and installed

-Gotta get used to pushing updates that I do more often, finally made some updates today. Should be a natural thing due to all the documentation I do in my tickets currently, plus I have it open on another window in VSC.
